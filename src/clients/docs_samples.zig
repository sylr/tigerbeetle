        \\

        \\## 1. Create accounts
        \\
        \\This project starts by creating two accounts (`1` and `2`).
        \\
        \\## 2. Create pending transfer
        \\
        \\Then it begins a
        \\pending transfer of `500` of an amount from account `1` to
        \\account `2`.
        \\
        \\## 3. Fetch and validate pending account balances
        \\
        \\Then it fetches both accounts and validates that **account `1`** has:
        \\ * `debits_posted = 0`
        \\ * `credits_posted = 0`
        \\ * `debits_pending = 500`

        \\transfer only affects **pending** credits and debits on accounts,
        \\not **posted** credits and debits.)

        \\## 4. Post pending transfer
        \\
        \\Then it creates a second transfer that marks the first
        \\transfer as posted.
        \\
        \\## 5. Fetch and validate transfers
        \\
        \\Then it fetches both transfers, validates
        \\that the two transfers exist, validates that the first
        \\transfer had (and still has) a `pending` flag, and validates
        \\that the second transfer had (and still has) a
        \\`post_pending_transfer` flag.
        \\
        \\## 6. Fetch and validate final account balances
        \\
        \\Finally, it fetches both accounts, validates they both exist,
        \\and checks that credits and debits for both account are now
        \\*posted*, not pending.
        \\
        \\Specifically, that **account `1`** has:
        \\ * `debits_posted = 500`
        \\ * `credits_posted = 0`
        \\ * `debits_pending = 0`
        \\ * and `credits_pending = 0`
        \\
        \\And that **account `2`** has:
        \\ * `debits_posted = 0`
        \\ * `credits_posted = 500`
        \\ * `debits_pending = 0`
        \\ * and `credits_pending = 0`
